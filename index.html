            <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>The purpose of this project is to develop a privacy-preserving healthcare application that utilises the Private-Set Intersection(PSI) protocol. 
                    Specifically, the project seeks to create a system which allows an individual to determine the risk of contracting a particular disease, 
                    without the need to reveal their sensitive genetic information to healthcare providers.
                    By implementing this PSI protocol, the system essentially ensures the privacy of both the individual client and the healthcare provider 
                    whilst allowing for the disease risk assessment to be carried out based on the intersection of the individual's genetic data and the hospital's set of disease-causing genes. 
                </p>

            <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>
                    The Private Set Intersection protocol, is a cryptographic technique that allows two parties to compute the intersection of their sets without 
                    revealing individual elements. In the Diffie-Hellman based PSI, both parties will perform a key exchange 
                </p>

            <h3>Introduction: What is Private Set Intersection (PSI)? </h3>
                <p>
                    Private Set Intersection (PSI) is a secure two-party computation (2PC) problem that allows for two parties to compute the intersection between both sets of data, 
                    while the elements that are not in the intersection remain private to the other party. There are many different approaches to this problem, however, for this project, we will be focusing on the Diffie-Hellman based PSI approach. <br />

                    How can you find an intersection of two private data sets without revealing the contents of each data set? <br />
                    
                    Preprocessing: We will first generate a cryptographic representation of the private sets through methods such as encryption or hashing. These will be used to hide the actual values in the sets for both parties.
                    Comparison: The cryptographic representation of the 2 sets is compared to determine the intersection. Comparison must be performed in a way that the actual elements in the sets remain confidential.
                    Output: Result of the PSI protocol is the intersected elements. Both parties would know the identity of the intersected elements as they know the original element of the set. <br />
                </p>
                <p>  
                    To illustrate, this is a basic process of how the Diffie-Hellman based Private Set Intersection works:  <br /> <br />
                    
                    1. Initial Setup:  <br />
                    a. Two parties, known as Alice and Bob, agree on a DH group description, including a generator g and an order q.  <br />
                    b. They also have hash functions (e.g., H) to ensure the original set data stay hidden. <br /> <br />
                    
                    2. Protocol Execution:  <br />
                    The protocol consists of four rounds: <br /> <br />

                    a. Alice: <br />
                      I. Picks a secret random exponent a from the range [0,ùëû) <br />
                     II. Hashes all items in her input set ùëã   <br />
                    III. Raises the hashed set to the power of ùëé and sends the results to Bob. (ùëã ) <br /> <br />

                    b. Bob: <br />
                      I. Picks a secret random exponent b from the same range.  <br />
                     II. Follows the same procedure as Alice, with his input set ùëå  <br />
                    III. Raise the hashed set to the power of ùëè and send the results to Alice. (ùëå ) <br /> <br />

                    c. Alice: <br />
                     I. Receives Bob‚Äôs message and raises it to the power of ùëé. (ùëå ) <br />
                    II. Send the result back to Bob. <br /> <br />
                    
                    d. Bob: <br />
                     I. Receives Alice‚Äôs message and raises it to the power of ùëè. (ùëã ) <br />
                    II. Send the result back to Alice. <br /> <br />
                    
                    The intersected elements are now revealed, as both parties can compare the common elements in ùëã and ùëå . <br />
                    As Alice knows the original elements in ùëã, and Bob knows the original elements in ùëå, both parties will know the original intersected elements, while remaining oblivious to the identity of the other elements. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    What are the benefits of using PSI? <br /><br />
                    
                    PSI allows privacy of the information to be preserved, while allowing for a meaningful exchange of information between two parties. No additional information aside from the intersected elements is disclosed, <br />
                    ensuring both parties‚Äô data remain confidential. This can be useful in multiple ways, and this is explored in the two examples below: <br /> <br />
                    
                    Voting - PSI allows the user to check if a voter is accidentally registered in 2 different states by checking if any registered voters intersect in the list of voters between the two states. <br />
                    Doing this through the use of PSI maintains the privacy and identity of the other voters to the other state. <br /><br />
                    
                    Healthcare - PSI allows for the user to compare his/her genes against the hospital‚Äôs database to compute the risk of a particular disease without revealing her genes. On the other hand, <br />
                    the hospital also does not wish to reveal its discoveries to the user as the hospital has spent time and money researching the genes. As this data is private to both the user and the hospital, <br />
                    PSI allows for the user to only discover the risk of the disease without revealing additional information. <br /><br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    What are some challenges of implementing PSI in our application? <br /><br />

                    1. Asymmetric Gene Set Size <br /><br />
                        The specialised hospital is expected to have a significantly larger set of gene
                        set data as compared to the patient. This would lead to an asymmetric gene set
                        size between the two parties, which may significantly increase the computation
                        time. Certain protocols need to be implemented to ensure the computation
                        process remains efficient. To address this issue, cuckoo hashing can be used to
                        ensure a constant time lookup of the data, ensuring that the application remains
                        efficient. <br /><br />

                    2. Ensuring Privacy of Gene Sets <br /><br />
                        A collection of individual gene data is known and stored in a database. If
                        hashing alone is used in the process of PSI, malicious attackers may use
                        dictionary attacks to compromise the privacy of the patient or the hospital. To
                        address this issue, homomorphic encryption can be used to ensure the privacy
                        of both parties. Homomorphic encryption allows for computation of the data
                        while it remains encrypted, allowing both parties to determine the intersected
                        sets without revealing additional information. <br /><br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is oblivious transfer and how can it be used in PSI? <br /><br />

                        Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF) Preprocessing is a two-party protocol
                        between a server and a client. The main property of OPRF is obliviousness, where the
                        server learns nothing about the client‚Äôs input, while the client does not learn anything
                        about the server‚Äôs secret key. (IETF, 2020) <br /><br />
                        
                    To illustrate how OPRF can be used in PSI we have two parties Alice (the Client) and
                    Bob (the Server). <br /><br />

                        1. Alice holds a private set of items, denoted as ùëã, while Bob holds another private
                        set of items, denoted as ùëå. <br />
                        2. OPRFs allow Alice to evaluate the PRF function on her set ùëã using Bob‚Äôs secret
                        key. The result is an ‚Äúoblivious‚Äù output. <br />
                        3. Bob remains unaware of the specific items in Alice‚Äôs set, and Alice learns
                        nothing about Bob‚Äôs secret key. <br />
                        4. After evaluating the OPRF, Alice sends the oblivious output to Bob. <br />
                        5. Bob can then check whether the items in his set ùëå match the received output. <br />
                        6. If there‚Äôs a match, it implies that the corresponding item is in the intersection of
                        ùëã and ùëå. <br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is homomorphic encryption and how can it be used in PSI? <br /><br />

                        Homomorphic encryption allows mathematical operations on data to be carried out on a
                        ciphertext. There are a few types of homomorphic encryption: <br /><br />

                        Partially Homomorphic encryption - Only a defined operation can be performed infinite times
                        on the ciphertext. Relatively easy to design. <br /><br />

                        Somewhat Homomorphic encryption - Limited number of addition or multiplication operations
                        are allowed. More difficult to design a system that supports a set number of operations than
                        one operation infinite times. <br /><br />

                        Fully Homomorphic encryption - Infinite number of additions or multiplication for ciphertext is
                        enabled. Programs for any functionality can run on encrypted inputs to produce an encrypted
                        output. <br /><br />

                        How does homomorphic encryption work? <br /><br />
                        For a given message m, we want to apply capitalising to m. <br />
                        First we encrypt m. <br /> 
                        C=enc(m). <br /> 
                        Evaluate another function f(x)=x+127 on C to get a new encrypted value C'=f(C) <br /> 
                        Then we can decrypt C' to get the computed message back. <br /><br />
                </p>  
                <p>
                    What are the problems implementing homomorphic encryption? <br /><br />

                        Efficiency: Homomorphic encryption is computationally expensive. Performing operations on
                        encrypted data takes significantly more time than on plaintext data. <br />

                        Resource Intensive: It requires substantial memory and computational resources, especially
                        for fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes. <br /><br />

                    What is Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)? <br /><br />

                        Secure Multi-Party Computation deals with the protection of input data of 2 parties
                        communicating with each other. One such method is known as Shamir‚Äôs Secret Sharing. Two
                        (or more) parties secretly distribute a secret (such as an encryption key), with each party
                        obtaining 1 part of the secret share. The secret will remain concealed unless a minimum
                        number of parties (the threshold) collaborate to reconstruct the secret. <br /><br />

                    What is Cuckoo Hashing? <br /><br />

                        Cuckoo Hashing is a form of open addressing where each non-empty cell in a hash
                        table contains a key or a key-value pair. It uses 2 hash functions to determine the
                        location for each key and requires a table of size 1.5 times the number of keys. The
                        presence of a key can be found by examining the corresponding cell in the table. To
                        illustrate: <br /><br />

                        1. We have a hash table of 2 arrays, A and B. <br /> 
                        2. When inserting a key, we compute its hash, using both hash functions. <br />
                        3. If the cell in array A corresponding to the first hash function is empty ‚Üí we 
                        place the key there. <br />
                        4. If the cell in array A corresponding to the first hash function is full ‚Üí we evict the
                        existing key from array A and move it to array B. <br />
                        5. We will then insert the new key into the vacated cell in array A. <br /> 
                        6. If the cell in array B corresponding to the second hash function is also occupied,
                        we repeat the process potentially evicting another key. <br /> 
                        7. The cycle continues until we find an empty cell or reach a max number of 
                        iterations. <br />
                    
                </p>
            <h3>SWOT</h3>
                <img src="C:\Users\agkgg\OneDrive\Desktop\FYP Repo\FYP-24-S2-21\pictures\Screenshot 2024-05-19 170815.png" alt="SWOT PICTURE">
                <p>
                    Based on the SWOT analysis, by applying the Diffie-Hellman based PSI protocol, it allows us to achieve greater privacy between parties in the healthcare industry, 
                    opens greater collaboration with other working industries that handle like-minded sensitive data, optimises efficiency in treatment and diagnostic with the greater 
                    ease in combining datasets and also encourages innovative solutions in modern healthcare analysis. <br />

                    However, in order to achieve the above successes, our implementation has to invest in optimising algorithms to reduce the computational extensiveness and 
                    implement interoperable solutions and standards to ensure flexibility and scalability.	 <br />
